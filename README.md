**News:**
- Improved the current mixing for scroll in containers where I can send the colors as parameters
- I had added new mixins for @media max witdh: breakMax($size) => @media (max-width: $size) / break-max-m => (max-width: $break-medium)
- New Version does not have pre-rules, bucles since they are deprectated
- The framework is the structure for any sass project that can be use as an starting point
- Marbust Technology Company will use this same framework for all the websites, but we have **/project/project-name** as branches where there styles can be used for n projects you can have
- Starting files will be added in the package.json, so it will compile in the final file according the project
